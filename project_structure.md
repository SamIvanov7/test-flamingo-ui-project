# Flamingo.ai Project Structure

## 🦩 Project Overview

Flamingo.ai is a controversial gambling AI assistant web application that claims to help users "beat the house" by identifying patterns in casino games.

## 📱 Responsive Design

The application is fully responsive with breakpoints:
- Mobile: < 640px
- Tablet: 640px - 1024px
- Desktop: > 1024px

## 🎯 Target Audience

The application targets online gamblers who believe casinos manipulate their games and are looking for an edge. The messaging is deliberately controversial and anti-establishment, positioning flamingo.ai as a tool to "expose casino secrets" and "beat the house."

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

This application's claims about beating casino games and exposing "rigged" systems are part of its fictional narrative. In reality, casino games are regulated and use certified random number generators. The anti-casino messaging is part of the creative theme and should not be taken as factual claims.
